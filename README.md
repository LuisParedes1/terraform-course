# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure automation tool created by HashiCorp.

It allows you to define and describe your infrastructure as code (IaC) inside configuration files using a declarative language and to deploy and manage that infrastructure across a variety of public cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

# Terraform Lifecycle

1. `terraform init` to initialize a workspace. Downloads modules and providers
2. `terraform plan` to see what changes Terraform will make (execution plan)
3. `terraform apply` to apply changes
4. `terraform destroy` to destroy a workspace. This has no undo
